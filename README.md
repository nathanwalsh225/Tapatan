While developing this application I was using two devices, my personal HUAWEI P90 Lite, and a Pixel 8 Pro API 35 emulator, on each device the screen was a different composition errors
I tried my best to improve the look to ensure it remained consistant on multiple screens but the one I used the most was the Pixel 8 Emulator 

I ran into some timing issues with my additional feature, which was supposed to allow the user to upload their own images for the tapatan pieces, I was unable to fully complete this a additional feature, I left the code I was working on for it in the application.
It wont have any effect on the performance of the application is more just in case marks are going for 'unused' code

Additonal Feature - The current working additional feature is that the user is allowed to customize the game piece with a few different images included in the code, the upload custom image code is incomplete
